# Basic Prompt Structures Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on two fundamental types of prompt structures:
1. Single-turn prompts
2. Multi-turn prompts (conversations)

We'll use OpenAI's GPT model and LangChain to demonstrate these concepts.

## Motivation

Understanding different prompt structures is crucial for effective communication with AI models. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, straightforward queries, while multi-turn prompts enable more complex, context-aware interactions. Mastering these structures allows for more versatile and effective use of AI in various applications.

## Key Components

1. **Single-turn Prompts**: One-shot interactions with the language model.
2. **Multi-turn Prompts**: Series of interactions that maintain context.
3. **Prompt Templates**: Reusable structures for consistent prompting.
4. **Conversation Chains**: Maintaining context across multiple interactions.

## Method Details

We'll use a combination of OpenAI's API and LangChain library to demonstrate these prompt structures. The tutorial will include practical examples and comparisons of different prompt types.
